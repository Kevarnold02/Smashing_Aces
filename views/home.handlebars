            <h5 class="center">What is Three Card Poker</h5>

            <p class="light">Three Card Poker is played with a single 52-card deck and is actually two games in one. First, the Pair Plus game allows players to wager on whether they will be dealt a Pair or better, or not. Secondly, the Play/Ante game allows players to wager against the house (dealer) to see who has the highest hand.</p>

            <h5 class="center">How to play</h5>

            <p class="light">The two pots are known as “Three Card Ante/Raise”, and “Pair Plus”. Three Card Ante is simply the player against the dealer, where the highest winning poker hand wins, whereas Pair Plus is paid out for hands with a minimum of one pair or better. </p>

                <p class="condensed light">The two pots are known as “Three Card Ante/Raise”, and “Pair Plus”. Three Card Ante is simply the player against the dealer, where the highest winning poker hand wins, whereas Pair Plus is paid out for hands with a minimum of one pair or better.</p>
                <p class="condensed light">The game is played with a standard 52-card deck on a modified poker table. Rather than simply one betting circle, 3 Card Poker boasts three: Ante, Pair Plus, and Raise. Initial bets take place before cards are dealt, and players can bet solely on the minimum Ante, or on both the Ante and Pair Plus circles. Since both pots are played separately, players can bet different amounts. </p>
                <p class="condensed light">After the first round of betting is completed, the dealer will give players three cards each, all face down. After looking at the cards, a player must choose to fold or raise their bet.  If a player folds, they must sacrifice their Ante as well as their Pair Plus bet, if they made one.  If a player does not wish to fold, they must automatically raise their bet and play the rest of the round out. </p>
                <p class="condensed light">At the completion of betting, the dealer's hand is turned over and cards analyzed to reveal the winner. Initially, the dealer must “qualify” to win the hand. To qualify, they must have a hand of at least Queen high; if not, the Ante is paid out even money and the Pair Plus bet is returned to the player. If the dealer does qualify, then the Ante/Raise pot is paid out to the highest hand winner. The player will win the Pair Plus pot if they qualify with at least a one pair hand, otherwise the dealer will collect it. </p>
